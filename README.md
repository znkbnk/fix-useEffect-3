The project provides a code example with
intentional mistakes for developers to
practice and enhance their understanding
of the useEffect hook in React, allowing
them to identify and correct the errors
to ensure proper functionality.

Mistake 1: Missing dependencies in the
first useEffect hook:

Problem: The dependencies array is empty,
which means the effect will only run once
when the component mounts, but won't
update when any state or props change.
Solution: Include the count dependency 
in the dependencies array so that the 
effect is re-run whenever count changes.

Mistake 2: Missing cleanup function in 
the second useEffect hook:

Problem: The effect doesn't have a 
cleanup function, which may lead to 
memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Add a cleanup function that
clears the interval when the component
is unmounted.

Mistake 3: Inconsistent parameter names
in the second useEffect hook:

Problem: The parameter name used in the
effect (count) doesn't match the parameter
name used when updating the state (prevCount).
Solution: Update the parameter name used
in the effect to match the state update
function (prevCount).

Mistake 4: Missing dependencies in the
third useEffect hook:

Problem: The dependencies array is empty,
so the effect will only run once when
the component mounts and won't update
when any state or props change.
Solution: Include the data dependency
in the dependencies array to re-run 
the effect when data changes.

Mistake 5: Updating data state incorrectly
in the third useEffect hook:

Problem: The data is updated using the
spread operator, but it incorrectly appends
the new result to the existing data.
Solution: Change setData([...data, result]);
to setData(result); to replace the existing
data with the new result.

Mistake 6: Missing dependency in the fourth
useEffect hook:

Problem: The dependencies array is empty,
so the effect will only run once when the
component mounts and won't update when any
state or props change.
Solution: Include the count dependency in
the dependencies array to re-run the effect
when count changes.

Mistake 7: Updating count state incorrectly
in the fourth useEffect hook:

Problem: The setCount function is called 
with the existingcount value, instead of
using the previous count value to update it.
Solution: Change setCount(count + 1);
to setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
to correctly update the count based on
the previous value.

Mistake 8: Key warning in the data.map function:

Problem: The key prop for the list items 
is set to the index, which can lead to
poor performance and incorrect rendering
when the list items change.
Solution: Ensure that each data item has
a unique identifier, such as an id property,
and use that as the key instead of the index.

Mistake 9: Using index as key in the
data.map function:

Problem: Using the index as the key assumes
that the list items will never change
positions or order, which can lead to
rendering issues or incorrect behavior.
Solution: Use a unique identifier,
such as item.id, as the key for the list
items to ensure stability and proper rendering.
